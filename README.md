Copy files recursively from a compuer to a server. 

After all imports in the global variables
insert your source and destination folders

Function findNew(list[], int) will look up all files in
a folder all files in list and look for newer
than int and return all files newer.

Function copy_file will copy newer files to 
Destination folder and log the action.

The program creates 2 lists of 4 components if there are
4 folders to copy from if Less is needed number can change

After that the set up for the recursive 
Copying of files is created.
